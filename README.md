1.What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?                                                               Ans: at first i've to say that, getElementsById and getElementsByClassName uses element attribute to select elements while querySelector and querySelectorAll uses CSS selectors for searching . In furthur comparison getElementById returns elemnt or null while getElementsByClassName returns HTML collection . querySelector and querySelectorAll are pretty similar but querySelector returns the first element it found , querySelectorAll returns the whole collection as node list.
2.How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?                                                                                                                        Ans: Using document.createElement('tagName') to create the element and next i'll use innerText or innerHtml and after that i'll use appendChild.
What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?                                                                                                                                      Ans: Event Bubbling is the process where an event originates on the target element and then propagates upward through its ancestor elements in the DOM, allowing each ancestor to potentially react to the event. When an event occurs on an element, it first runs the event handler on that element, then it "bubbles up" to its parent, then the parent's parent, and so on -all the way up to the document.
What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?                                                                                                                      Ans: Event Delegation is a technique of handling events by taking advantage of event bubbling. It Reduces the number of event listeners, Easier to manage one parent listener than many child listeners.
What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?                                                                                                Ans: preventDefault() Prevents the default action that the browser would normally perform on that event, It does not stop the event from bubbling . While stopPropagation() Stops the event from bubbling any further up or down the DOM tree.
